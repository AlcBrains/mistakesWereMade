Given an array with values, perform the necessary adjustments so that the max number in said array is the 
count of distinct values. Do not alter the position of each element, and do not change their relevant values.

eg. for array { 2, 9, 5, 3, 15, 11, 29} the correct output should be { 1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5 ,7}
